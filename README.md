Password Generator
==================

This python script generates passwords in the style of 
[correcthorsebatterystaple](https://xkcd.com/936/). The script is very
rudimentary, but it does use [cracklib](https://github.com/cracklib/cracklib)
to test that any generated password is reasonably hard to crack.
